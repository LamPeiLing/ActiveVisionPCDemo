## Abstract

The main purpose of this project is to provide valuable insights into the performance of tennis players and analyze in-game strategies. The key focus is on tracking the trajectory of tennis balls, which is critical for effective in-game analysis. However, this task poses significant challenges due to the small size of the tennis ball and its high-speed movement, which can cause blurring or occlusion in some frames of the videos. Our model must learn and detect the ball’s trajectory pattern accurately. Additionally, the project also evaluates players’ performance by tracking their locations, poses, and swing angles during gameplay. Finally, cross-platform development may be carried out to make this analysis accessible and practical for users if time allows.
